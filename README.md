# Koine Greek Gloss Database

This repository holds a collection of gloss data sets generously compiled by a collection of contributors. The purpose of this project is to collect Koine Greek gloss data sets that may be freely used by any person, school, website, and free/paid software packages without limitation or restriction of any form.

This database is focussed specifically on the Koine Greek vocabulary found in Koine Greek Christian documents. This includes the New Testament, LXX, and related literature. Vocabulary outside of these data sets may be included if it is helpful for educational purposes.

# Contributors

Contributors are always welcome, if you would like to contribute you
can send us a message in github. To start a new language, copy the
English language data file as your template, and update as many
glosses as you can, then submit the file back. Preferably via github.

As much as possible, each gloss should be a single word as it would
appear inline in an actual bible in your target language. However, in
some cases, slightly expanded glosses are desirable or necessary for
clarity.
